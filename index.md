# About 

My research interests are in image reconstruction inverse problems and the
software to compute and render those images.

I am currently an imaging scientist at [Openwater](https://www.openwater.cc/). 
Our goal is to make medical imaging more accessible by using  near infrared lasers, holograms, ultrasound and high volume consumer electronics manufacturing.
This makes for a very interesting image reconstruction, of which I am currently working on. 

Previously I was a research scientist in the [Applied Nuclear Physics](https://anp.lbl.gov) group at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory working on gamma-ray imaging, especially image reconstruction algorithms and real-time data fusion to make 3D gamma-ray maps of radioactive sources. 
This took me to interesting places around the world to perform dozens of live field measurements and demonstrations.

I also make [music](/music) with improvised saxohpone and a program that generates electronics.
