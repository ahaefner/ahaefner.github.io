# Music 
_saxophone, improvising, jazz, electronics, computer_

I created a music generating software program to combine my interests in improvising music and making software. 
I made the program to explore how randomness can be harnessed to create structure. 
My goal was to create music that didn't sound random but was based on underlying random notes.
The program allowed me to compose by tweaking sets of parameters that controlled the music generation in real-time. 
Then I could improvise with these electronically generated sound zones on saxophone.

This youtube playlist is almost an album worth of music. 
All the tracks were made in a continuous take by playing alto saxophone while the computer generated the electronics.
